# NIMZ-at-SemEval-Task-9-BRAINTEASER

# This project is about:
Answering multiple-choice riddle-like questions, regarding the SemEval2024-Task-9-BRAINTEASER, which includes two subtasks: Sentence Puzzle and Word Puzzle.
We have trained and evaluated BERT-Base and RoBERTa-Large LMs, T5-Large and QA-GNN on the BRAINTEASER task dataset.

## About the notebooks in this repository:
- **BERT_base_Sentence_Puzzle_Eval_phase.ipynb**: The notebook for training BERT_base for Sentence Puzzle subtask.
- **BERT_base_Word_Puzzle_Eval_phase.ipynb**: The notebook for training BERT_base for Word Puzzle subtask.
- **RoBERTa_Large_Sentence_Puzzle_Post_Eval_phase.ipynb**: The notebook for training RoBERTa_large for Sentence Puzzle subtask.
- **RoBERTa_Large_Word_Puzzle_Post_Eval_phase.ipynb**: The notebook for training RoBERTa_large for Word Puzzle subtask.
- **T5_large_sentence_puzzle_v1.ipynb**: The notebook for training T5_large for Sentence Puzzle subtask.
- **T5_large_word_puzzle_v1.ipynb**: The notebook for training T5_large for Word Puzzle subtask.
- **QA_GNN_brainTeaser_v14.ipynb**: The notebook for training QA-GNN for Word Puzzle and Sentence Puzzle subtasks.
